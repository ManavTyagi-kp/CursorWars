# CursorWars

So, before you go ahead, I just want you to know that this game or whatever it is, is a result of a few drinks and a little nerdy brain. 
This game has no logical sense whatsoever, but still I had a great time playing it with my friends and I just wanted to share.

Requirements:
<!-- BADGES/ -->
  All you need is a decent syatem, with a running JAVA IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.
  And two mouses connected to the same computer.
  So, if you have a laptop and a mouse, you can use the track pad, and the mosue to play this game.
<!-- BADGES/ -->
 
 Yes, this game is based on the absurdity that you face when two devices try to move the cursor at the same time. 

So, let's see how this shit works:
# The module consists of two games in two packages:

  1. The first package is named "CanvasBattle1", when you run the module from the main class, something like this shows up:
  
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83765713/191834592-909e05ca-479b-44dd-ba81-0adee8d7e4ff.png)
      
      Now, both the players can pick a color, and start popping rectangles of the color you picked.

      The player that is able to pop more rectangles WINS.
      
      The timer of the game starts as soon as the canvas appears, and at the end of timer(45s by default), the timer stops,and the canvas is destroyed.
      
      The scores appear in the "run" console of your IDE, the player witht the highest score at the end of the game WINS:
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83765713/191836149-46c243f0-a087-4726-9b93-cb1ac6848cb9.png)
     
     
  2. The second package is named "CanvasBattle2", this one is a little more interesting, when this module is run, something like this shows up:
  
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83765713/191836886-d253ea78-559b-4bc8-8b53-7b22a35b1aac.png)
      
      Now, in this game you need to pick sides, left is "RED" and right is "BLUE".
      
      Once you have picked sides the motive of the game is to keep the cursor in your part of the screen for as long as possible.
      
      Right click on the mouse and drag it to your side of the screen.
      
      The longer it stays in your side, the more points you get, which is also visualized by the color of the cursor drag.
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83765713/191837716-9a916457-11cd-44b1-adde-dee4bf179b98.png)
      
      At the end of the timer, the canvas is destroyed and the color with the highest points WIN.

As I said earlier, the game was made out of fun, but I will keep adding updates to it anyway.
Incase you get any interesting ideas around the same concept, please feel free to connect, maybe we can build something together.
